An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a machine learning model inspired by the human brain.
It consists of interconnected layers of artificial neurons that process information and learn patterns from data.
ANNs are widely used in image recognition, natural language processing (NLP), robotics, and predictive analytics.
